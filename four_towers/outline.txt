# The Four Towers
## Summary
An evil wizard has infested the world with his magic. Deep in the Black Forest, the tendrils of his evil reach out across the land, destroying all they come across, and poisoning peoples minds.
Hidden away in a small hut a Wizard and his apprentice learn of the evil growing in the Black Forest by a letter, and the Master Wizard sends his apprentice out in the world to restore the power of the Four Elemental Towers: Earth, Wind, Fire and Water.
Only the combined power of the Towers can stop the darkness that threatens the land.
